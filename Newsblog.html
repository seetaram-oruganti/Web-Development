    <h2>British Airways pilots vote to accept jobs deal
</h2><img src ="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/43A5/production/_113771371_ba-pilots.jpg">
      <p>British Airways pilots have voted to accept a deal that will temporarily cut pay by 20% and eliminate 270 jobs, says the pilots' union Balpa.<br><br>

The deal prevents a controversial "fire-and-rehire" scheme where staff would have been handed new contracts "on worse conditions".
<br><br>
The 20% pay cuts will reduce to 8% over two years and to zero in the long term.
<br><br>

The ballot result saw 85% of members accept the deal on an 87% turnout.<br><br>

    <p>Australia's virus-hit state of Victoria has reported its worst death toll and case rise, prompting fears that a six-week lockdown of state capital Melbourne is not working.
<br><br>
The state confirmed 13 new deaths and 723 new cases on Thursday - a 36% jump on the case record set on Monday.
<br><br>

There are fears now that Melbourne's lockdown, which began on 7 July, will need to be extended.

The spike meant Australia overall had its deadliest day in the pandemic.
